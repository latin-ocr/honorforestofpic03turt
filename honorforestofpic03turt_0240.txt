most substantial persons, elected a woodward up to the date of the
last Eyre, for whom the commoners were willing to answer in Court,
and his duty was to guard the wood and the common therein lest
strangers should consume it. Further‚ the lords of Pickering from
time immemorial, as well in the time of the King's ancestors as of the
Earls of Lancaster, always had the chief guardianship of the wood ; and
neither Amary Gegge nor William Thurnef nor Thomas de Ebberston‚
whose estate in the wood Robert Wyerne and Thomas Thurnef have,
ever had a woodward except one elected by the commoners. On this
ground they are ready to prove that the allowance of the claim enured
to the prejudice of the King‚ the Earl and the other commoners of the
township. Further‚ they say that none of the predecessors of the
claimants Amary Gegge, William Thurnef or Thomas de Ebberston
ever had or claimed to have the bark of any oaks given to any persons,
except from their own tenants and from the small occupiers in the
township at the time when Thomas de Ebberston‚ father of the
Thomas de Ebberston‚ who sold the manor to Amary Gegge and
William Thurnef, was bailiff of the manor of Pickering3 when the
small occupiers gave him the bark and oak out of pure good will and
as a gift. After Thomas de Ebreston was removed from his bailiwick
and office he never appointed a woodward, received any bark, or
* Probably should be “ de Ebreston.”
