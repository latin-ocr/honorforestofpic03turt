COUCHER BOOK. 95

dicit quod ipse est Abbas Rievalle de novo creatus, et predictus
Abbas qui clamia predicta in itinere isto posuit, post diem predictum
sibi datum obiit, et petit quod ipse per 1100 in hac parte non
prejudicietur.÷÷ Et super hoc inquisita inde veritate per forestarios,
viridarios et regardatores ejusdem foreste compertum est per eosdem
quod predictus Abbas ut predictum est obiit, ideo nichil ulterius de eo
etc„ et* predictus Abbas qui nunc est, statim posuit clamia sua hic in
Curia ut patet alibi.

Robertus Lambsone clamat esse quietus de pannagio porcorum
suorum in Foulwode‚ Haibourn, Dernclif et Parva Clif infra limites
foreste tempore pannagii per annum, et dicit quod ipse et omnes ante-
cessores sui a tempore quo non extat memoria racione terrarum et
tenementorum suorum que habet in Brunston, que sunt francum
feodum, quieti fuerunt de pannagio tempore pannagii ut pertinenti ad
terras et tenementa sua predicta, et hoc paratus est verificare prout
Curia ete.

Ideo inquiratur inde veritas per 'ministros ejusdem foreste. Qui
scilicet forestarii, viridarii et regardatores ad hoc jurati dicunt super
sacramentum 51111111 quod idem Robertus et omnes antecessores sui a
tempore quo non extat memoria racione terrarum et tenementorum
suorum predictorum quieti fuerunt de pannagio porcorum suorum
tempore pannagii tanquam pertinenti ad tenementa sua predicta. Ideo
consideratum est quod idem Robertus quietus sit de pannagio predicto,
salvo semper jure etc.

crated Abbot of Rievaulx‚ and that the Abbot who made the claims
in the eyre has died since the time when he was directed to appear on
this day. He prays that he may not suffer any prejudice in conse-
quence of this. Inquiry being made as to the truth of this by the
forestem, verderers, and regarders the Abbot is found to have died, as
had been stated, and proceedings against him are stayed. The present
Abbot immediately made his claim in Court, as appears elsewhere.†

Robert Lambson claims to be quit of pannage for his pigs in Ful-
wood, Hayburn, Derncliff‚ and Little Cliff, within the forest, during
the mast season, and he pleads that, by virtue of the lands of frank
fee tenure which he holds in Burniston‚ he and his ancestors have been
from ancient time quit of pannage during the mast season. This he
is ready to prove.

Inquiry is directed, and it is found that Robert and his ancestors
have, by reason of their tenure of the said lands, and as appurtenant to
the same, from ancient time been quit of pannage during the mast

* i.e.—That the claims may not abate in consequence of the Abbot‘s death.
