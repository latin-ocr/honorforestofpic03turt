INTRODUCTION. xxix

tract of land in question lies to the south of Pickering—roughly speak-
ing, bounded to the south by the Derwent and to the west by the Costa.

Eustace son of John, the ancestor of the Vescys, appears to have
had some claim to pasture on it, which, by grant from him, confirmed
by Henry ΙΙ., devolved on the Priory of Malton. A controversy
between the two Houses arose which was eventually compromised by
the mediation of the King, and the priory were permitted to have
common of pasture there for the thirty oxen with which they tilled
their lands at Malton, two bulls and thirty cows with their calves up to
the age of one year.

We find that in general a Religious House holding land within the
forest was entitled to special exemptions. This was especially the
case with the Monks of Rievaulx3 they enjoyed rights of fishery in the
Costa, Rye and Derwent (pp. '8 and 139), as the Canons of Malton did
in the two latter (p. 161). They could assart land, build houses and
sheepfolds, and agist at will 3 they were exempt from lawing of their
dogs and of all assizes of the forest except those relating to game,
regards and hare-hunting.

Two important Houses of Gilbertine Canons, offshoots of Sempring-
ham, appeared and made their claims in somewhat similar language3
the Priory of Maston, already referred t0‚ and the Priory of Ellerton.
It is not probable that any large proportion of the burdens from which
they claimed exemption existed in Pickering Forest3 probably they
took that opportunity of placing their rights upon record, possibly they
did it from excessive cantion, not caring to dispute whether the
burdens existed or not. Their claims are, however, interesting,
because they give us (see pp. 104, 109) definitions of two forest
customs. One, that of buckstalls, or, as it was also called, stabz'lilio ,· the
custom, namely, that compelled tenants within a forest to make enclo-
sures into which the deer were driven 3 the other that of trists, namely,
the custom that certain persons were to hold hounds at fixed points
where the deer was likely to run in order to intercept them. I have,
in the Introduction to Vol. ΙΙ., N.S., p. xxxviii, told how this method
of hunting is mentioned in the “ Maister of the Game.⁷'

As inthecase of so many other Religious Houses, both Priories claimed
to be exempt from lawing of their dogs 3 the same exemption was claimed
by the Prior of Bridlington (p. 6), the Dean and Chapter of York
(pp. 127 and 155), and the Knights Hospitallers (pp. 141 and 144).

, At the angle formed by the junction of the Rye and Derwent is a

meadow formerly known as Edusmarsh, and afterwards as Castle Ings.
In the sixteenth century it certainly belonged to the Duchy, and it
may have been the meadow referred to at Vol. ΙΙ., N.S., p. 15, as
sixty-six acres of demesne meadow.
