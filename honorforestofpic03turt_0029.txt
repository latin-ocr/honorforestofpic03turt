Blansby Park throughout the year: namely‚ a penny a foot from every
beast taken only once or twice 3 the amount of the fine was the same
in the seventeenth century (see Vol. II., N.S., p. 4). The verdict of
the Jury is interesting as showing the gradual development of the
forest. Formerly they said, before Blansby Park was enclosed, when-
ever a forester or woodward found an animal straying the fine belonged
to him as part of the perquisites of his office, but this perquisite ceased
on the enclosure os the Park. The same right also existed as regards
Dalby Launde until a forester at fixed wages was appointed, when the
rule was made that if the Earl's forester found such an animal present-
ment was made at the Court of Attachments, and the fine belonged to
the Earl ; otherwise, if the forester in fee found it, he retained his old
perquisite. In making their claims the foresters in fee each claimed
the fine only if ward had not been made (warda tamen inde non facta).
It is a phrase that has given me some difficulty, and I have made a
short note on it, which can hardly be called satisfactory, at p. 47. In
addition, I would refer to the Surtees Society, Vol. LXIX.‚ p. 218,
where the same phrase occurs.

A joint right to the fines for straying cattle also existed in the barony
of Middleton. Thomas Wake (pp. 151, 152 and 160> claimed them,
and it was found that he was entitled to them if his foresters were the
first to seize them in the woods and rnoors, but not in the arable land,
and if the Earl's foresters were the first to find them, then presentment
was made at the Court of Attachments and the Earl had the fines.
The claim at p. 152 is somewhat confused owing to the scribe of the
Coucher Book having apparently misread bestiis on the Rolls for boscis.

BRIDGES AND ROADs.

IN theory, if not in practice, every Englishman in person or by
deputy was bound, amongst other things, to repair and maintain roads
and bridges. In this respect the lands of the Church did not differ
from those of the laity, and a gift in frankahnoign freed the lands so
given from all services except those included in the trimoda necessitas,
How the obligation to repair bridges was enforced up to the reign of
Henry VIII. is not quite certain 3 so far as roads were concerned the
obligation seems principally to have been enforced by the Manorial
Courts, who appear to have proceeded on a sort of general rule that
those whose lands adjoin a highway ought to repair it—a rule which has
occasionally been adopted in modern Acts of Parliament.

But however this obligation ought to have been enforced, there
seems little doubt that in practice it was almost a dead letter, and had
it not been for the Religious Houses the means of locomotion would
have been even more difficult than they were. While we find few, if
