2 DUCHY OF LANCASTER RECORDS.

suerunt et pro voluntate sua dederunt tanquam partem manerii predicti
[258b] et hoc paratus est verificare per ministros istius foreste etc. Et
quia manifeste liquet Curie per responsionem ipsius Johannis quod
idem Johannes est in hac parte ad proficuum capiendum in foresta
predicta et non apposuit inde clamium suum in instanti Itinere primo
die ejusdem prout moris est et proclamatum fuit, consideratum est
quod libertas predicta capiatur in manum domini etc.‚ et nichilominus
respondeat domino de valore ejusdem per medium tempus etc.
Postea venit predictus Johannes et peciit quod possit admitti ad finem
faciendum cum domino pro clamio suo inde apponendo et admittitur
per finem dimidie marce per plegium Ricardi de Naulton.

Iidem jurati presentant quod quidam pons qui vocatur Frerebrigg ultra
aquam de Costa per quam [sic] homines solebant transire de Pikeryng
usque Malton equites et pedites, pons predictus modo in tantum
dirutus est et confractus quod homines predicti ibidem transire non
possunt set circuiunt aliunde per forestam istam ad spacium unius
leuce ad nocumentum et conculcacionem et consumpcionem pasture
ferarum domini Comitis foreste predicte 3 et Abbas de Ryevall et omnes
Abbates loci predicti tenentur illum reparare. Ideo preceptum est
vicecomiti quod venire faciat eum. Postea venit predictus Abbas et
non dedicit quin ipse et omnes Abbates loci predicti tenentur pontem
predictum reparare, sed dicit quod pons predictus non est dirutus
neque confractus ad presens, quin homines ibidem pertransire possunt

manorial rights. He asks that the officers of the Forest may try the
question. As it clearly appears to the Court by the answer of Sir
John that he is making a claim to take a profit in the forest which he
did not claim on the first day of the Eyre, as the custom is and as
proclamation was made, judgment is given that the liberty be seized
into the Lord’s hands, and Sir John is to answer for its value in the
meantime. Afterwards Sir John appears and prays that he may be
allowed to pay a composition for making his claim, and a composition
of 6⁵ 8d is fixed. Surety‚ Richard de Naulton.

The jury also present that a bridge called Friar Bridge beyond the
Costa, across which people are wont to pass on horseback and on foot
going from Pickering to Malton‚ is in such bad repair that people cannot
pass over, but have to make a divergence of about a mile and a half in
the forest, treading down and injuring the pasturage of the deer. The
Abbot of Rievaulx and all Abbots of that place are bound to repair it.
He is summoned, appears and does not deny that he and they are
bound to repair it, but he says that the bridge is not in such bad repair
that people cannot pass over it as they are wont and ought to do
without doing harm to anyone. He asks that an inquiry may be made
