COUCHER BOOK. 129

Qui scilicet forestarii, viridarii et regardatores super hoc jurati et
onerati dicunt super sacramentum suum quoad hoc quod predictus
Decanus et Capitulum clamant esse quieti de herbagio pro se et
hominibus suis infra divisas predictas, et similiter de pannagio, ex-
peditacione canum et putura omnium ministrorum foreste predicte*
Et quoad habendum housebote et haibote et capere cablicia et siccum
boscum dicunt quod iidem Decanus et Capitulum et ornnes predeces-
sores sui a tempore quo non extat memoria ceperunt housebote et
haibote per divisas in predicto clamio suo contentas per visum
forestariorum et similiter [305] cablicia et siccum boscum ad terram
prostratam sine visu forestariorum habuerunt, si autem forestarii feodi
venerint et subboscum predictum et cablicia manu operaverint [?].
Dicunt eciam quod iidem Decanus et Capitulum et omnes predeces-
sores sui a tempore quo non extat memoria semper habuerunt sub-
boscum prout clamant ad campos et curtilagia sua in Pikeryng
claudendos et similiter virgas ad utensilia carucarum suarum in

Decani et Capituli quod capere debent virgas† ad utensilia carucarum

Decanus et Capitulum nichil capiant in hac parte, set sint in misericordia

dowry of their church. This they are ready to prove and an inqniry is
directed. The jury find that the claims of the Dean and Chapter to be
quit of payment sor herbage with the limits aforesaid for themselves
and their men, and likewise of pannage, lawing of dogs and puture of
all the office-rs of the forest [have been proved]. They say that the Dean
and Chapter and their predecessors have from ancient time taken
housebote and hedgebote with the limits mentioned in the claim at
view of the forestem, and likewise had browsewood and dry wood felled
to the ground without view of the foresters, but only if the foresters of
fee came and cut the underwood and browsewood. They also say
that the Dean and Chapter and their predecessors have from ancient
time had the underwood claimed for enclosing their fields and
curtilages in Pickering, and likewise poles for the harness of their
ploughs (but this at view of the foresters) and likewise the right of
collecting'nuts within the boundaries claimed. Judgment is given that

it had only been exercised willz view.
