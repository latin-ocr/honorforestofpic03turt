the east part of Langdale wood, which has been from time immemorial
appurtenant to their freeholds. They pray that the matter be

In the last† Forest Eyre Fullwood‚ [common in] which is appur-
tenant to their freeholdS, was held to be waste and was ransomed so
that it ought not to be otherwise than within the regard, but the
tenants have been disturbed from enjoying their common by Earl
Thomas and his officers. They pray that this matter also be
remedied.

The petition to King and Couneil of Nicholas at the Bridge of
Pickering. John de Dalton, formerly bailiff of the Earl of Lancaster,
at Pickering, wrongfully, and under colour of his office, took Nicholas
in Pickering town and detained him in prison in his house from the
27th of May, 1319, to Saturday, the 14th of July next following, and,
out of greed for his land, said that Nicholas was bound to the Earl in
more than A 10 for many suits in arrear and other defaults.

* “d' ’⁸ is the last letter.
† The petitionis so illegible that Ι can only offer this paraphrase as the merest
conjecture.
