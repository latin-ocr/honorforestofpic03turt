INTRODUCTION. XXV

In this volume we find two instances where roads and bridges are
alleged to be repairable by Religious Houses. One (p. 4) called the
bridge of Pul, must have been somewhere near F oulbridge‚ the contest
lay between the Prior of St. John of Jerusalem and the Prioress of
Yedingham. It was common ground that between them the road and
bridge ought to be repaired. The jury found that the bridge was
entirely constructed on land belonging to the Prior, and that he ought
to repair it as well as the road to the east of the bridge, while the Prioress
was only bound to repair the road to the west, which at that time was
not out of repair. This bridge was a bridge for carts and carriages.

In the other instance (p. 2) it was the Abbot of Rievaulx who was
presented for not repairing a bridge called F riar Bridge beyond the
Costa on the highway leading from Malton to Pickering. In con-
sequence of the non-repair it was said that persons passed through the
forests, treading down the pasture ancl destroying the food for the deer.
The Abbot did not deny his liability to repair it, and indeed repaired
it during the Eyre—a course that did not absolve him, but no doubt
was considered in mitigation of his fine.

It is noteworthy that the grant to the Abbey of Rievaulx by Henry ΙΙ.,
of the waste below Pickering, in respect of which the burden of
repairing the bridge is said to have been created, is set out at p. 167 of
the Rievaulx Cartulary (Surtees Society‚ Vol. LXXXIII.); and yet there
is no reference to the land being subject to any such burden, nor is
there any reference to it in the confirmation of the grant by Richard 1.,
at p. 127 of the same gvolume3 while at p. 261 it is distinctly stated
that King Henry gave the monks the land in exchange for land at
Stainton‚ which Walter de Gant had given to them as the site for their
Abbey.

Through the courtesy of Mr. J. D. Whitehead, to whom Ι have had
to make a similar acknowledgment in my first volume, I arn enabled
to sketch out the probable history of the Friar Bridge and the road
leading to it. The bridge itself must, I think, be that now known as
Howe Bridge, almost at the junction of the Costa and Derwent 3 but
as against this view (see p. 162, n.) Howe Bridge is referred to under
that name in the extracts from the Rolls‚ also copied in the Malton
Coucher 3 although it appeared in some legal proceedings of the year
1876, that the Pickering and Malton road has been slightly deviated
in recent yearS, yet Mr. Whitehead informs me that all the old tracks
seem to have converged to the point where the bridge now is.
At the date of the Eyre it was evidently a pack bridge only, zie.
used for foot passengers and riders; and when it was altered into a
bridge for carts and earriages, it would naturally follow that it became
a county bridge 3 and this Howe Bridge at the present date is.
