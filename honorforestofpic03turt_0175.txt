COUCHER BOOK. 1 37

quieta de omni tementale,* danegelda et omnibus auxiliis et assisis et
geldis, et omnibus consuetudinibus et occasionibus et placitis, et de
omni servicio terreno quod sibi et successoribus suis unquam pertinuit
per cartam predictam quam hic profert et que hoc testatur3 et dicit
quod virtute carte predicte ipse et omnes Abbates loci predicti prede-
cessores sui semper a tempore confeccionis carte predicte hucusque
quieti fuerunt in maneriis predictis de expeditacione canum et de
omnibus aliis assisis foreste predicte3 et hoc paratus est verificare per
ministros ejusdem foreste. Ideo inquiratur inde veritas per eosdem
ete. Qui scilicet forestarii, viridarii et regardatores ad hoc onerati et
jurati dicunt super sacramentum suum quod a tempore quo non extat
memoria semper presentatum fuit ad attachiamenta istius foreste de
canibus predicti Abbatis et predecessorum suorum in maneriis suis del
Marreis non expeditatis, et aliquando ministri ejusdem foreste acces-
serunt ibidem ad canes predictos videndos, set idem Abbas nec aliquis
predecessorum suorum unquam aliquid solverunt seu finem fecerunt
cum eis pro ipsis non expedimus, et licet idem Abbas vel predecessores
sui amerciati fuissent hac de causa, tamen aliquando per donurn†
suum custodi castri vel ejus locum tenenti qui pro tempore fuerit
datum, et aliquando per favorem eorundem nichil solverunt.

Ideoss dictum est eidem Abbati quod expectet inde judicium suum
hic die Lune proximo post mensem Pasche. Ad quern diem apud
Pikeryng coram prefatis Ricardo de Wylughby et Johanne de

customs, prosecutions, pleas and lay services towards himself and his
successors. He produces the deed and vouches its contents. He is
ready to prove that he and all' former Abbots have by virtue thereof
enjoyed the quittances claimed. An inquiry is directed, and it is found
that from time immemorial presentments have always been made at
the Attachment Courts with regard to the dogs of the Abbots in the
manors of the marishes not being lawed, and at times the officers of
the forest have gone there to view the dogs, but neither the Abbot nor
any of his predecessors ever paid a fine or made a composition for not
lawing them. Even though they were fined, sometimes by bribing the
keeper of the Castle or his lieutenant, and sometimes by their good-
will, they never paid the fine. Judgment is reserved until Monday,

⁴* This word, which is a corruption of tien man tale, originally implied that ten
men were to be sureties one sor the other, a later development of which was the
law that every man was to be in a tithing. Asterwards it appears to have been the
name for a tax of 23. on every carucate ; see Roger Hoveden, ann. 1194, p. 737.
Du Cange, s.v. Tenmantale, suggests that most probably the tithing, as a whole,
was liable [or the tax imposed on its several members.

† For an instance of such a gift being accounted for, see Vol. IL, N.S., p. 26.
