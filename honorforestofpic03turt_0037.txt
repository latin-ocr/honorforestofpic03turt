GENERAL HISTORY.

AT pp. 224—228 will be found some'of the Wardrobe Accounts. They
commence with the expenses of Edward II. when at Pickering. This
was his second visit there, almost a year and a half after the death of
Earl Thomas. In 1322 the Scots under Robert Bruce had entered
England, and amongst other places had spoiled the monastery of
Rievaulx. We find a reference to this in the repayment to Sir Roget
de Felton of his ransom of Α 100, which his capture by the Scots,
October 10, 1322, had exacted from him. It will be remembered
(Vol. I., N.S., p. 4) that it was on the 17th October, 1322, that hostages
were delivered to Robert Bruce for payment of the ransom of Pickering
Lith. We learn from the account that the King hunted the stag there,
and paid to one of his huntsmen 10s for his day²s employment. It was
not an uncommon thing for a King to celebrate his stay at a place by a
large distribution of alms 3 for instance, when Edward ΙΙΙ. was there in
1334 (just before the commencement of the Pickering Eyre) he spent
12S ὀᾶ on 100 poor, three halfpence each, but if the Warclrobe Accounts
contain the whole of Edward IL’s generosity, his gift was limited to the
sum of three pence.

From Pickering Edward ΙΙ. passed over the moors to Whorlton
Cassse, where he intended to stay with Nicholas de Meynell. His
journey appears to have taken him at least a week 3 what was the
course that he followed, and where he stayed, Ι cannot even conjecture.
He went by Lockton, and probably passed over Spaunton Moor,
which seems to correspond with what is called Blakho Moor 3 Green-
how might be the moor above Ingleby Greenhow3 but this is far too
much to the north. We should expect him to have gone through
Bransdale and Bilsdale 3 dropping down into the low country not far
from Faceby. The difficulty would be to find any place to stop at.
Perhaps being fine weather they camped out. It seems to have been
a hunting expedition, for he spent the sum of ,ζ 5 and more at Scar-
borough in the purchase of cord for his hunting nets.

At Whorlton the hunting seems to have consisted of taking roedeer
in the Park; while in the evening he had an opportunity of judging
whether Yorkshire deserved to be so famous for its singing as it was. It
is interesting to note that the song chosen was one relating to Simon de
Montfort. Two such are printed in the book prepared by Mr. Wright,
for the Camden Society, and I believe that they are the same as those
references to which Ι have given in the note.

The Accounts of Edward 111. do not throw much light on his life
