INTRODUCTION. xiii

to serve in those troubled times. He is described (at Vol. ΙΙ., N.S.‚
p. 121) as the holder of the first and last office, and in the present
volume (at p. 240) as the holder of the second. At the earlier passage
it was his duty to account for all deer killed and oaks felled during
his term of office; at the later passage he had to execute arrests.
The rents and other payments due to the Earl passed through his hands
as bailiff and receiver (see Vol. ΙΙ., N.S.‚ p. 14), while as bailiff it
was also for him and not for the sheriff to serve all writs and
summonses within the precincts of the liberty.

The connection existed not only in respectos the chief Officers,
but also of the subordinates. At p. 213, infra, there is a list of the bailiffs
of the Earl of Lancaster, who distrained the beasts of Sir Robert de
Scarborough. Referring to the other places in the two volumes where
the same names occur, it seems probable that they were all foresters
and under-foresters.

It is obvious that this connection between law and hunting gave an
enormous importance to the position of a forester. Not satisfied with
the wages which they were paid (infra, p. 15), their constant endeavour
seems to have been to have established their right to those perquisites
which in other forests pertained to foresters. To one of these——
namely, putare, I have often referred. This word occurs twice
in the volume with a slightly different meaning. At p. 22 5,
it is used to denote the keep of a greyhound‚ and at p. 227, for
food provided for the poor. Elsewhere it is used to denote the*
right that foresters claimed to compel the inhabitants to keep gratis
them and their servants on board for a certain number of days in each
year. This custom is referred to in the Introduction to the “Year
Book '' (11—12 Ed. HL, “ Rolls Series,'' p. xxiv, 269-275), and also in
the Coram Rege Roll, Hil. Term, 6 Ed. 111„ m. 31, with regard to
Inglewood Forest.

The case in the Year Book was a claim by the forester of Inglewood
against the Abbot of St. Mary’s, York. He claimed food and drink at
the table of the Abbot's grooms, on Friday in every week, together
with the right to carry away, whenever he pleased, a flagon of the best
ale in the abbot's cellar, and two tallow-candles from the abbot's
chamber, a bushel of oats for his horse, and a loaf of black bread for
his dog.

I do not think that this custom ever obtained any foothold at Picker-
ing, although we constantly find cases (see p. 15, infra) in which
foresters were attempting to set it up, and it was probably to provide
against the success os any such attempts that we find the Prior of
Malton, at p. 104, the Prior of Ellerton, at p. 108, and the Dean and
Chapter of York, at pp. 128 and 155, all claiming to be exempt from
