INTRODUCTION.

ΟΝΕ or two matters in the preceding volumes call for note. At
Vol. 1., N.S., p. 209, the word taverzzed gave me some trouble. Ι have
since found the explanation of it at Surtees Society, Vol. XXII„ p. 18.
It means to let or lease.

There is also a correction that Ι would wish to make at Vol. ΙΙ.,
N.S., p. xxv. In mentioning that Edward ΙΙ. was after his deposition
committed to the custody of Henry, Earl of Lancaster, Ι referred to
Pontefract as the Castle in which he was confined, this should have
been another of the Earl's castles—namely, Kenilworth‚ from which
the King was afterwards removed to Berkeley Castle, where his death
occurred.

The second Series of the Records is now rapidly drawing to a close.
Unless there is an unexpected increase to the number of our members
the next volume will be the last 3 but to some extent this will be
appropriate, since it will conclude the Pickering Eyre. This being so,
Ι will pass over the general features of this volume until Ι have an
opportunity of reviewing the Eyre as a whole, and will, in this
Introduction, merely call attention to one or two points that arise
incidentally.

THE OFFICERS OF THE FOREST.

At p. ²42 I have printed one of the class of documents known as
Ancient Petitions, which throws a considerable amount of light upon
the state of the times. In the first place the petition suggests a doubt
as to the legality of the grants of Pickering to the Earl of Lancaster
after Simon de Montfort’s death. Pickering was part of the Crown
Lands, and while the inability to alienate Crown lands is not distinctly
stated, the suggestion is made that the grant was temporary only, and
until other lands of equal value could be provided for Edmund ; a
suggestion for which there is foundation in the language of the
original grant to Earl Edmund. In this connection it must not be
forgotten that it was not until the commencement of the reign of
Queen Anne that an Act of Parliament (1 Anne, st. 1, e. 1) was
passed, forbidding (by sect. 5) the alienation of Crown Lands. If
