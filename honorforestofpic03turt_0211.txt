ciariis de foresta nisi per viridarios aut forestarios de feodo inventi
fuerint cum manuopere. Quas quidem concessiones dominus Edwardus
quondam Rex Anglie, pater domini Regis nune, illas recitando con-
cessit et confirmavit ; et dicunt quod virtute cartarum predictarum ipsi
usi fuerunt libertatibus predictis tempore quo foresta et castrum pre-
dicta fuerunt in manu progenitoris domini Regis nunc; et dicunt quod

domini Edwardi avi domini Regis nunc itinerantes ad placita foreste
venerunt apud Scardeburgh ad omnia placita foreste et omnes querelas
ejusdem foreste ipsos tangencia ibidem placitanda et terminanda, et
burgenses rettati‚ indictati seu attachiati pro transgressione venacionis
