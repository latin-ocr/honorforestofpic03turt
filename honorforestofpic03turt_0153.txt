quo non extat memoria presentarunt unum wodewardum in moris et
boscis suis de Alverstan et alium wodewardum in moris et boscis suis
‘de Farmanby⁷ et quoad clamium suum construendi bercarias in mora
de Alverstan scilicet in Ardolvestan et eas habere et tenere et aliis
quibuscumque dimittere pro voluntate sua dicunt iidem ministri super
sacramentum suurn quod a ternpore quo non extat memoria habebat
quendam bercariam ab antiquo edificatam cujus muri adhuc stant,
quam quidem bercariam antecessores predicti Radulphi edificarunt et
habuerunt et tenuerunt et dimiserunt pro voluntate sua, et idem
Radulphus eam adhuc edificare, habere et tenere potest ut de jure
suo ab antiquo si velit, set quod nec ipse nec antecessores sui unquam
ibi construerunt [301b] seu habuerunt aliquas bercarias ut clamat, et
quoad clamium quod clamat in Farmanby quendam boscum qui vocatur
Langowedale per divisas in eodem clamio contentas, et habere ibidem
viridum per assisam foreste pro housebote et haibote, et siccum capere,
vendere, et dare et omnino inde voluntatem suum facere, dicunt iidem
ministri super sacramentum suum quod idem Radulphus nec aliquis
antecessorum suorum unquam aliquo tempore aliter fuerunt inde
seisiti, nisi quod omnes wodewardi ipsius Radulphi et antecessorum
suorum a tempore quo non extat memoria usi sunt capere de hominibus,
mulieribus et pueris communam* non habentibus portantibus siccum
boscum super eorum capita† qualibet septimana unum denarium vel
aliquando unum obolum de bosco predicto, salva hominibus ejusdem
ville communa sua, et si iidem homines et mulieres vel pueri nichil
solverint eidem, summoniti fuerunt veniendum ad curiam ipsius Radulphi

without adverse claim or hindrance from the bailiffs or foresters 3 they
have likewise presented one woodward for Allerston and another for
Farmandby. But as to the sheepfolds they say that Sir Ralph had a
sheepfold built long ago whose walls are still standing 3 his ancestors
built it, occupied it and leased it at pleasure, and Sir Ralph can, if he
please, do the same as his prescriptive right, but neither he nor his
ancestors ever erected or occupied any other sheepfolds as he claimS.
As to Langatdale‚ they say that the only right that Sir Ralph or any
of his ancestors ever had therein was that all their woodwards from
ancient time were accustomed to take from men, women and children,
who had no common of estovers and carried dry wood away on their
heads, sometimes a penny and sometimes a halfpenny a week, saving
all rights of common, and if the men, women or children did not pay they
were summoned to Sir Ralph's court and fined there for their offence.

⁴* The contraction for causam is used.
† It is interesting to notice how ancient this method of carrying firewood is. 1t
may, perhaps, be said that no other method is physically possible.
