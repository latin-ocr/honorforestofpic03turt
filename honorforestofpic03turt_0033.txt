INTRODUCTION. xxvii

volume, it is evident that the brz'dge was for foot passengers and horse-
men only3 but it does not necessarily follow that the read was
designed for similar traffic only, and not for carts and carriages also 3
such carts and carriages might have passed over an adjoining ford of
which the name Wath Hill, in the vicinity‚ preserves some trace.
When the bridge was altered I do not know, but in the reign of
Elizabeth (24 ΕΠΖ.) (see Vol. IL, O.S.‚ p. 301), it was spoken of as
Howe Bridge, and 2552 was spent on its repair. It was therefore then
a county bridge.

RELIGIOUS Housns.

A FEW words may not, perhaps, be out of place to enumerate the
number of Religious Houses who either held land within the forest of
Pickering, or in some way or another became subject to the jurisdic-
tion of the Court. First in importance came the Abbot of Whitby.
He not only held lands at Goathland, but as the forest of Whitby
marched on its west boundary with the east boundary of the forest of
Pickering, disputes arising out of hunting were no uncommon occur-
rence. The claim of the Abbot of Whitby will be printed in the next
volume, and any remarks had better be deferred until then.

The Abbey of St. Mary's, York, was the neighbour of the Earl of
Lancaster on the west. The Forest of Spaunton, strictly speaking,
did not belong to the Abbot, the land did (see Reg. Mar„ fol. 177),
but the game belonged to the King, whose foresters were not, however,
allowed to enter, the Abbot having the custody of hart, hind, wild-
boar and hawk: this also sufficiently appears from pp. 266-271 of
Vol. ΙΙ., N.S., and p. 258 of the present volume. By grant from King
Henry I., confirmed by Henry IL, the Abbot of St. Mary's was entitled
to tithe of venison throughout the county of York; he also had the
custody of the Forest of Spaunton, and an exchange was made 3 the
Abbot surrendered his right to the tithe in the forest of Galtres, and
by way of compensation had the forest of Spaunton 3 the arrangement,
however, was for a limited time only, namely, five years. The arrange-
ment does not seem to have given entire satisfaction to the Abbot.
It was rare to find deer in Spaunton Forest, and the tithe in Galtres
was better worth having. The Abbot petitioned either that he might
have the tithe in Galtres again, or that the exchange might be perma-
nent instead of temporary, and that he might have license in mortmain
to purchase land at the value of Α 20. The petition does not appear
to have been granted, and the arrangement was renewed for a further
term of five years.

The grant of tithe to the Abbot is worthy of observation. After
p. 1 18 was passed through the press I had an opportunity of collating
