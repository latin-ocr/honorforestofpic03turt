Et dicit quod dominus Henricusf* filius Imperatricis, quondam Rex
Anglie, progenitor domini Regis nunC, dedit et carta sua confirmavit
Deo et Sancte Marie et ecclesie sue de Rievalle et monachis ibidem
Deo servientibus pro anima gloriosi Regis Henrici, avi sui, et pro anima
patris sui et matris sue et fratrum suorum in liberam, puram et
perpetuam elemosinam totum vastum suurn et totam pasturam
subtus Pikeryng cum pertinenciis suis; in quo quidem vasto maneria
predicta modo situata sunt, in pratis et pasturis, in aquis et piscariis et
molendinis, et in omnibus aliis rebus per certas metas in eadem carta
contentas; concessit eciam eis quod infra ipsas divisas domos et
bercarias edificent et terram colant et excerceant per totum sicut eis
placuerit, et prohibuit ne aliquis infra predictas metas cum averiis intrare
vel turbam fodere vel in aliqua re se intromittere nullo modo presumeret
sine voluntate et licencia eorum super forisfacturam suam. Unde dicit
quod virtute carte predicte ipse et omnes Abbates loci predicti pre-
decessores sui a tempore donacionis et confirmacionis [Ρ carte] predicte
seisiti fuerunt ad domos et bercarias ibidem edificare et terram suam
ibidem excolere et excercere pro voluntate sua, et virtute carte predicte
ipse et similiter omnes Abbates loci predicti, predecessores etc., semper
hucusque a tempore predicto usi sunt predicta libertate, quod
nullus minister foreste de Pikeryng aut alius forestarius quicunque
se quicquam in maneriis predictis intromittant, preter ipsum

regard to game 3 and likewise claims the right of agisting. He pleads
that Henry, son of the Empress Maud, granted in frankalmoign to
the Church and monks of Rievaubr, for the souls of his grandfather
Henry 1.‚ and of his father, mother and brothers, the whole waste and
pasturage below Pickering, in which waste the said manors are now
situated‚ together with the meadows, pastureS, waters‚ fisheries and mills,
according to the boundaries specified in the deed of gift. He also
granted to them the right within these boundaries of building houses
and sheepfolds and bringing land into cultivation at their pleasure, and
he forbade any one entering there with beasts, or cutting turves, or
intermeddling in any manner without license on penalty of forfeiture.
Wherefore the Abbot claims that he and his predecessors have ever, from
the date of the gift, been seised of the right of building houses and sheep-
folds and bringing land into cultivation at their pleasure. Likewise,
in virtue of this deed, he and his predecessors have always hitherto
enjoyed this liberty, that no forester or other officer of the forest of
Pickering, but only the Abbot and his Officers, ever intermeddles with
the manors except only with regard to game, when there happens to be
found dead or caught any hart, hind, buck, doe or roedeer within
