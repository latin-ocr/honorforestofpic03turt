CONcLUsmN.

THE difficulty of determining what names are place-names and what
surnames, in even a general sense, has been as great in this volume as in
the preceding ; Ι have, however, in most cases retained the de, and only
translated it where there seemed a more than ordinary probabilty that
it only referred to the locality.

To those whom I have thanked in the preceding volumes‚ my thanks
for similar services are again due, as well as to those whose names
appear in other parts of this volume ; in addition to them I must
mention Canon Temple, by whose kindness Ι was enabled to see the
Register of St. Mary’s Abbey, at a time when Ι fear that it was
inconvenient to him, and when the Dean and Chapter Library- was not
open to the public.
