106 DUCHY OF LANCASTER RECORDS.

expediens est et necesse quod Curia cercioretur super possessione
ipsius Prioris in 1136 parte, inquiratur inde veritas per ministros ejus
dem foreste. Qui scilicet forestarii, viridarii et regardatores ad hoc
jurati et onerati dicunt super sacramentum suum quod quoad hoc quod*
idem Prior vel homines sui ceperint aliquod boscum vel subboscum in
eadem foresta extra† assisam ejusdem, ipse et homines sui semper
amerciati hucusque fuerunt et adhuc sunt, velut alii homines ejusdem
foreste. Dicunt tamen quod ipse et homines sui et similiter predecessores
sui et eorum homines semper a tempore confeccionis carte predicte
quieti fuerunt de vigiliis faciendis corporum ferarum mortuorum, et
dicunt quoad hoc quod ipse et homines sui sint quieti de escapiis‚
geldis, fotegeldis‚ bukstallis et tristis quod nec Prior qui nunc est nec
homines sui 1166 aliquis predecessorum suorum seu eorum homines
unquam virtute carte predicte inde disportati fuerunt seu quieti.
Et dicunt quod quoad carreium et summagium ipse Prior et homines
sui et omnes predecessores sui et eorum homines inde virtute carte
predicte extiterunt quieti. Dicunt eciam iidem ministri quod quoad
housebote et haibote quos clamat habere in boscis predictis, idem
Prior et omnes predecessores loci predicti semper a tempore quo
non extat memoria usi sunt habendi housebote et haibote in boscis
predictis tanquam pertinentes ad liberum tenementum suum quod tenet
in eisdem villis prout superius declaravit. Ideo [299] consideratum

claims may be allowed. As it appears expedient to the Justices that
the Court should be informed as to Prior's possession, an inquiry is
directed and it is found that the Prior and his men have always been
and still are fined whenever they took any wood or underwood in the
forest beyond the assize‚ like other men in the forest. They say that
he, his predecessors and their rnen have always been quit of keeping
watch over the dead bodies of the deer, but as to being quitos escapes,
gelds‚ footgelds‚ buckstalls and trists, they say that neither the present
Prior, nor his men, nor any of his predeoessors, nor their men, were
ever excused‚‡ or quit thereos by virtue of the grant, but they
were quit by virtue of the grant of all payment for the passage of
carts and pack-saddle‚ and they have ever, from ancient time, been
accustomed to have housebote and hedgebote in the woods above
mentioned as appurtenant to their free tenements in the same townships,
as claimed above. Judgment is given that the Prior and his successors
