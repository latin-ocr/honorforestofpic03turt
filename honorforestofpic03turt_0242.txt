A. and B. before the Justices of Pickering Forest and allowed by
them should not be reversed so far as they claimed to have the right
of presenting their own woodward in Ebberston Wood and also to
have the bark in the same wood. The allowance of the claim was
said to be to the damage of the said Robert and the other commoners of
the township‚ and the record was brought by process of law into the
King’s Bench3 and they declared outside their writ that all the men of
the township had been wont to choose a woodward by the voice of
two or three of the most substantial.

They also claimed that the commoners had ever had fallen wood [P]
and reasonable estovers as common appendant.

Skipwith 3ss—The damages are alleged to have been suffered as well
by others who are not named in the writ as by those who are ; where-
fore we ask for judgment of the writ. Mowbray 3—-Notwithstanding
that others are alleged to have suffered damage a right of action is
given to those who are willing to plead, for our action ought not to be
prejudiced merely because all the rest are in accord with the
claimants. Skipwith 3—The two who now bring their action would not
have been allowed in the Eyre to have claimed for themselves and the
others. Bankwell 3—-If all had been named, to tell the truth‚ the nonsuit
osone would have made the writ abate, which ought not to be. ’ R.
Thorpe 3—The two had an assize without the rest. Bankwell 3—and if a

⁴⁶ Skipwith and Mowbray were Counsel, Bankwell and Robert Thorpe Justices.
