XXX INTRODUCTION.

We leam (at p. 162) that the Prior of Malton claimed the right to
pasture his cattle in this meadow after the hay had been carried.

For the most part, if not entirely, the possessions of the Knights
Hospitallers within the forest appear to have been those which
descended to them after the suppression of the Templars. Fowke-
bridge or Foulbridge has already been referred to; in addition there
was a Master of Stainton (pp. 48, 58), for whom the Prior had to
answer3 there were also lands at Allerston. A question arose with
regard to Foulbridge (p. 147). It was suggested that at the date of
the suppression of the Templars their lands fell as escheats to the chief
Lord, namely, Earl Thomas, who granted F oulbridge to John de Dalton
for his life, and thus the liberties annexed to the Manor of Foulbridge
became extinguished. Afterwards carne the Act of Parliament vesting
the lands in the Knights of St. John, and though I understand the
lease for life to John de Dalton to be admittedly superseded‚ yet the
argument appears to be that the liberties themselves were not revived.
The matter was eventually removed by writ of certiorari to the King's
Bench, but search on the Coram Rege Rolls has not resulted in the
discovery of the determination of the question.

With regard to Allerston a question of a different nature arose
(pp. 214—217). It was suggested that these lands formed a manor by
themselves, though, no doubt, held of Sir Ralph de Hastings, the
Lord of the Manor of Allerston. At the time of the suppression of
the T emplars Sir Ralph appears to have seized their land and held it
for some forty yearS‚ when the Knights of St. John attempted to
recover it. The readiness with which Sir Ralph gave way suggested
doubts to the minds of the Judges whether this was not a device to
evade the provisions of the Statutes of Mortmain, of which one in
more stringent form had only recently been passed. An inquiry as to
this was therefore directed, but the Jury found that the claim was
perfectly bona fide, and that the Templars had owned the land in
question.

According to Burton’s “Monasticon,'' p. 358, Father Robert de
Samford, minister of the Knights Templars in England‚ with the
advice and consent of the Chapter at London, granted to the monks
of Rieval a road beyond Grenehil in the‘territory of Allerston. 1 do
not find a reference to this grant in the Rievaulx Cartulary‚ although
at pp. 209 and 290 the road itself is referred to, and the probable date
of its grant by another person, John, son of Baldwin, is put by Canon
Atkinson somewhere about 1203. Moreover‚ in Pat. Rolls 5 Edward
IL, part 1, m. 2 [January 24, 1312]‚ there is a grant to Alexander de
Abernythy of, amongst other manors, the Templars' manors of Fouke-
bridge and Allerston. I only refer to this as to some extent con-
