xxii INTRODUCTmN.

days before to fifteen days after Midsummer Day, when the deer were
fawning and no one was allowed to walk in the forest for sear of
disturbing them. Again, pigs were seized because they were not agisted
and were pasturing in the mast season.

In the Inquisition above referred to it is said that no pannage was
payable in respect of mast for pigs, but this custom must have been of
very limited extent. In the East Ward it is quite clear that pannage
was payable. Certain tenants of frank fee tenure, a tenure that in
Ancient Demesne stood just above socage, claimed a right of pasturing
their pigs without paying pannage. Most, like Robert Lambson (p. 95),
limited their claim to the mast season, but Alan, the son of Alan of
Cloughton (p. 117), and Adam de Burneston‚ clerk (p. 140), claimed
to be quit of this payment throughout the year 3 the verdict found that
no tenants‚ whether of frank fee or socage tenure, were ever quit of
pannage during the fence month, and that all that the claimants could
prove was to be quit during the mast season, z'.e.‚ from 14 September
to 18 November. In these two cases the claim was limited to Full-
wood, Hayburn, Derncliff, and Little Cliff3 the Prior of Bridlington
(p. 125) extends his claims to the whole of Scalby, but the verdict
found that he never was so quit in Scalby Hay. The importance of
this lay in the fact that at pp. 47 and 48 the Prior of Bridlington,
Alan the son of Alan and Robert Lambson, then called Robert the
son of Lambert‚ were all presented because their pigs were found
unagisted within the covert, which I take to be Scalby Hay.

The claim of the Dean and Chapter of York (p. 126) should be
compared with the Inquisition, as by it they claim to be quit of
pannage throughout the Manor of Pickering, and though their title
rests on a deed couched in general language, the fact of non-payment
since the date thereos was more probably their stronger point. They
succeed (p. 155) in a similar claim as to Farmanby, Kingthorpe, and
Ellerburn.

As a rule goats could not be pastured in a forest3 the Prioress of
Wykeham (p. 97), in her claim for common of pasture‚ expressly
excludes goats‚ and when not mentioned they were tacitly excluded.
We do, however, find two instances where claims to pasture goats were
made and allowed 3 one (p. 99) by Gilbert de Ayton‚ and the other
(p. 112) by Ralph de Hasting.

Where cattle were straying in unlawful places they were seized, and
could only be replevied by their owners on payment of a fine. Such
cattle, or the fines on seizing thern, were known as escapes, and it was
often a question of dispute to whom the escape belonged. At pp. 83
and 84 Parnell de Kingthorpe and William de Percehay, as foresters in
fee, claimed the escapes in Dalby from Easter to Michaelmas, and in
