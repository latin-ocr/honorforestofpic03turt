and his force and put thern to death. Afterwards they have many
times been arrayed by the bailiffs‚ foresters and verderers to go with
force of arms against their liege Lord at York at the time of several

King, and at the siege of the Castle of Tickhill, but against the enemies
of Scotland they would not array, or allow to be arrayed, one man.

and ruined the people of the country by their power, so that the latter
are beggared while the former are rich in lands, tenements and fine
manors, though, when they carne into the country, they had nothing
but their bows and arrows and the clothes they walked in.
