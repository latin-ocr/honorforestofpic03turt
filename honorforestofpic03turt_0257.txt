The Jury also present that every time that Ebberston township is
charged with imperial taxation, for instance, when it is charged with A 5
for the fifteenth‚ Sir Robert de Scarborough, who is tenant of part of
the township, ought to pay 6S or 7s for his share. But he refuses to pay
anything‚ and the rest of the township have to make up the difference.

under colour of his office, he arrested one Robert the Dyer, lately
residing in Ebberston, bound his hands as it he were a selon, though
he had not been indicted‚ and took from a horse, harness and
other goods and chattels to the value of 20⁵. Afterwards he entrusted
him to his servant to take to York, but when they reached Malton the
servant let his prisoner escape.

offences committed by him in Yorkshire‚ sor which he was indicted in
the King's Bench and found guilty on his own confession, 6⁵ 8⁰¹.
