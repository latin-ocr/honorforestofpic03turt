xxviii INTRODUCTION.

its language with the Register of the Abbey in the Dean and Chapter
Library at York (Reg. Mar„ fol. 177). So far as the operative words
are concerned there is no difference of importance3 the York Book
inserts the words semper before habeant. The witnesses have, how-
ever, been incorrectly copied in the Duchy Coucher 3 they should have
been Humphrey Byng, capellanus, and Eudo Dapifer. A description of
the latter is given in Ellis's “ Introduction to Domesday Book,'⁷ Vol. Ι.,
p. 4153 he was the son of Hubert de Rie, and Steward of the House-
hold.

If my construction of the grant of tithe is correct the Abbot was
only entitled to a tithe of the dead deer 3 he was not allowed to hunt
himself, but after the day's hunting one-tenth of the game should be set
apart and delivered to him. We have at p. 227 a somewhat similar
instance of payment of tithes in respect of water-fowl, herons and
egrets3 only instead of a tenth of the “bag'’ being given, the value
of a tenth was given3 the gift was to the King's Almoner, and not to
any ecclesiastical corporation.

In the case of the Abbot, however, he seems to have got his tithe in
the following manner : he himself hunted the deer in the presence
of the keeper of the forest 3 if he took more than his proper proportion
the surplus was debited against him the next year 3 if he took less he
was allowed to make it up the next time that he came. For this offence
and for others, which will be seen at p. 121, the Abbot was fined the
large sum of 2445. At Vol. II., N.S., pp. 122-142‚ there are numerous
instances of tithes being delivered to the Abbot, but there is nothing
to show in what manner the delivery was made3 at p. 86, however,
there is a presentment against Alexander de Bergh for having taken a
hind‚ as he alleged by way of tithe, on behalf of the Abbot 3 the
offence presented is not that the Abbot ought not to have taken it,
but that Alexander had no warrant to do so.

How the custom to pay tithe died out Ι do not know, but it will have
been noticed that though, in Vol. Ι., N.S., pp. 156, 157, presents of
fallow-deer appear in the reign of Henry VII. to have been made to
the Abbot of St. Mary's, they are not stated to have been made in
respect of tithe.

The Cistercian Abbey of Rievaulx held a considerable amount of
land within the forest. We have already seen how they were bound to
repair a road and bridge. King Henry II. had granted to them the whole
of the waste below Pickering, and the Abbot also had land in Allerston
and Thornton (see Rievaulx Cartulary‚ Surtees Society, Vol. LXXXIII).
From the same source it appears that the waste was not entirely value-
less, but that several persons claimed or exercised rights over it, of all
which it became necessary for the Abbot to obtain a release. The
