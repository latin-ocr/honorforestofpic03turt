names have in part vanished‚ and possibly in part changed their
positions (for instance, Apple Tree Keld) ; it is difficult to say exactly
to how great an extent the claim was unsuccessful; but the general
position of the wood can be traced. Before leaving this claim I would
refer to psallerint (p. 154), which is the word used to denote the giving,
or singing, of the verdict by the Jury. Sometimes, as in the claim of
Thomas Wake (at p. 149), in respect of Holtwaitbank‚ and as in the
claim of Scarborough (p. 172), in respect of Falsgrave, we have a
claim that a distinct locality is quit of regard; sometimes, as at
pp. 107, 141 and 144, we have claims by the Prior of Ellerton, and the
Prior of the Knights of St. John, that all their woods wherever situated
are so quit.

A right, of which lords of manors appear at all times to have been most
tenacious‚ is that of appointing woodwards. Again we are left in some
doubt wherein the advantage consisted. The contest appears to have
been, if we may take Robert Wyerne’s case, before referred to, as a typical
instance, between an individual and the township at large. Whether
it wasa mere right of patronage that was at stake, or whether larger
issues were in question, must be left for future consideration. I have
indexed the names of woodwards that occur, and also the claims that
were made to appoint thern 3 it is, therefore, only necessary to sum-
marize them shortly. Sir John de Melsa appointed the woodward in
Levisharn 3 NicholaS‚ and afterwards Sir Ralph Hastings, in Allerston
and F armanby 3 the Prioress of Wykeham, in Wykeham and Ruston3
Gilbert de Aton, in Brompton and Hutton Bushe113 Robert de
Wyerne and Thomas Thurnef, in Ebberston3 Thomas de Pickering
and his wife, in Lockton 3 and Henry de Percy, in Seamer. In addition,
we find the woodward of the Prior of the Knights of St. John and
of the Master of Staynton. The only other woodwards mentioned are
the woodward of Thornton and of Thornton Riseborough. Possibly
these woodwards might have been chosen by the township at large.

It is worth while to refer again to the case of the Ebberston wood-
ward at p. 201. At first it will be noticed that Sir Robert pleaded
that two or three of the most substantial persons in the township elected
a woodward on behalf of the rest 3 it may possibly have occurred
to the pleader that it might be difficult to maintain that· Robert
Wyerne and Thomas Thurnef were not two of the most substantial
persons. At any rate, he amends his pleading, and at p. 207 describes
the election as being by all the commoners, and the presenlatz'on by two
or three in the name of the rest. This, however, raises the question
how, in fact, did an election take place? It would be absurd to
suppose that the modern method of counting heads and allowing equal

importance to ignorance and learning, to poverty and wealth, to
