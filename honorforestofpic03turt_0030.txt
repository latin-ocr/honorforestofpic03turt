xxiv INTRODUCTION.

any, cases in which the general common law obligation to repair roads
and bridges is enforced, we do find a considerable number in which
such an obligation, arising by reason of and as incident to the tenure of
certain lands, is the subject of legal proceedings‚ but in nearly every
case that I have met with the land was originally granted to some
Religious House.

A very typical instance of this is the Inquisition taken by the Sheriff
of Middlesex to ascertain whether the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield
ought, as Lord of the Manor, to repair the bridge at Hanworth‚ the
proceedings relating to which are reported in the Year Book 14 Ed. III.
(Rolls Series, p. 292). The jurors said that the bridge in question was
one near a mill for the benefit of the miller only, and of his neighbours
who wished their corn to be ground, but that it was not a bridge for
the common passage of the men of the country; the Bishop therefore
escaped liability. It is easy to see that what in its origin was a mere
matter of favour in process of time is liable to be claimed as a right.
As Sir E. Coke puts it (“Institutes,'’ Vol. ΙΙ., p. 700), “Nota if a
bishop or prior etc. hath at once or twice of almes repaired a bridge, it
bindeth not (and yet is evidence against him, untill he prove the con-
trary), but if time outv of mind they and their predecessors have
repaired it of almes, this shall bind them to it.''

That occasionally grants of land were made to Religious Houses for
the express purpose of providing for the repair of roads and bridges
there can be little doubt. The history of the bridges at Stratsord atte
Bowe is too circumstantially told on the Coram Rege Roll of Easter
6 Ed. ΙΙ., m. 95 (see “Abbrev. Placit.,'' p. 316), to be a pure fiction.
We are told that Queen Matilda, wife of Henry 1., originally built
these bridges and made the road between thern, and as she wished to
provide for their repair and thought that that object would be better
carried out by religious than by lay persons, she granted certain lands
burdened with this obligation to the Abbess of Barking, which lands
subject to their burden were afterwards transferred to the Abbot of
Stratford Langthorne.

The connection of the Religious Houses with the repair of bridges
and roads is considered at p. 35 et seq. of “English Wayfaring Life in
the Middle Ages '’ (fourteenth century), by J. J. Jusserand. He quotes
Elton's “ Tenures of Kent‚⁷’ at p. 21. The Monks of Christchurch were
bound to contribute to the repair of Rochester Bridge, and when their
monastery was dissolved, and their lands to a great extent given to the
new Cathedral of Canterbury‚ the'King⁷s letters patent contained these
words, “that lastly the gifts of alms to the poor, the repairing of roads
and bridges, and other pious offices of every kind may increase and
spread far andwide, we give and grant, ete.'’
