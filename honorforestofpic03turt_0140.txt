scilicet infra les Acredikes, prout superius clamat. Dicunt eciam quod
idem Gilbertus et omnes antecessores sui a ternpore quo non extat
memoria virtute carte predicte habuerunt capras suas depascentes in
moris et boscis de Hotonbussel, infra coopertum et extra, omnitempore
anni, et similiter eradicarunt brueram et fugeram in mora et bosco de
Hoton, et eciam turbas foderunt et eas pro voluntate sua dederunt,
vendiderunt et cariarunt infra forestam et extra, et similiter agistarunt
in Hotonker solummodo et [? non] alibi in eadem villa, et proficuum
agistarnenti illius ceperunt, et habuerunt wodewardos suos in Aton,
Brumpton et Hoton in boscis suis propriis infra forestam prout superius
clamat. Ideo consideratum est quod idem Gilbertus quoad hoc quod
clamat tenere boscum suum predictum in Troucedale extra regardum
foreste in parte ejusdem bosci a predicto fonte de Apiltrekeld per
quandam obliquam semitam usque ad locum qui dicitur Hevedgate-
browe, et inde per cilium bosci ascendendo adhuc in obliquo versus
orientem usque ad locum qui dicitur le Birk, et de eodem loco

Hutton Bushel, within the covert and without, at every season of the
year, and likewise uprooted heather and bracken in the moor and wood
of Hutton, dug turves therein, and at their pleasure gave, sold, and
carried them away within the forest and without, and likewise agisted
in Hutton Carr only, and not elsewhere in the township, and received
the profit of agistment, and had woodwards in their own woods of
Ayton, Brompton, and Hutton Bushel as he claims above. Judgment
is given that Gilbert takes nothing by his claim of having quit of
regard that part of his wood at Troutsdale from the spring of Apple-
treekeld uphill along a slanting path to Headgate brow, thence along
the brow of the wood still uphill obliquely towards the east to a place
