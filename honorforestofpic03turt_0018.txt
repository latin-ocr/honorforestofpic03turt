xii ⁷ INTRODUCTION.

Piekering could in any way revert to the Crown, then it was the
duty of the present possessor to keep it so that it could be restored iu
its original condition. This, the petition suggests, could not be
done; encroachments are being constantly made, oaks are felled,
game destroyed3 things were far better when the Earl Marshall was
forester in see.

But what was far worse was the enormous power which the possession
of such a forest gave to the Earl. He was in the position of a petty
king; his own men fought for him against Sir Adam Banastre3 nay,
they followed him in his several rebellions against the King, and on his
behalf they overawed Parliaments ; but all this was venial. They went
further: they compelled those who were tenants of the King to join
the Earl’s tenants and fight against their liege lord.

This is,I think, the meaning of the passage3 within the district
known as Pickering Lithe there were other sees besides the Lancaster
fee (see, for instance, p. 195), and the Earl's Officers compelled the men
who held of these fees to join with those who held of the Earl.
Although strictly in doing homage loyalty to the King was the tenant's
first duty, and loyalty to his lord his second, yet there seems great
probability that in practice the exact reverse was the usual custom,
and it is certain that a great distinction was drawn between the case
where a rebel simply followed his lord, and the case where he hessd
directly from the King and rebelled against him.

The last complaint of the petition was against the foresters them-
selves. It was a complaint which was as applicable to foresters of the
· King as to foresters of the Ear13 in the reigns of the Edwards the
officers of the forest were they who scaled the ladder of fortune the
quickest. Often strangers, like John de Monmouth, Roget de
Leicester, Henry de Ripley, &C., they came, so the petition states,
with nothing but their bows and arrow5, and in a short time they had
ousted the old families of Pickering, bought land, and settled there.
This seems to me the most valuable portion of the petition as a
picture of the times ε historically, I doubt if it is of much value. 1
doubt if Simon de Montfort was ever Lord of Pickering⁷ and if
Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk‚ was ever forester in fee of anything
beyond Scalby Forest, although, on the other hand, the suggestion, at
p. 207, that his bailiff, Thomas de Ebberston <see Vol. 11„ N.S., p. 41)
was also bailiff of Pickering, does bear out this suggestion. But as
to the power of the foresters there can be little doubt. It is signifi-
cant to note the intimate connection between the administration of
law within the honor and the management of the forest. The
constable of the Castle was usually bailiff of the liberty and keeper
of the forest. Take, for instance, John de Dalton, whose fate it was
