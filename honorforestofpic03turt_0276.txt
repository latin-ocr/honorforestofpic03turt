Α ce Sire ou chescun sraunk home purra avoir par lei et estatuit
atorne par brief de faire la seute pur lui a la court [P du seignour] de
qi il tent, et les tenauntz de la haute tenure de Pykering lour atornes
fesoient par briefs en la Wapentag de Pykering en temps du Roys et
toutz seignours du maner susdite taunt qe Thomas jadis Counte de

manor [=all the tenants between whom and the lord of the manor
there is a mesne lord] were wont and ought to make one coming
[venue=coming=appearance] at the wapentake [z'.e., the session of
the wapentake court] held next after Michaelmas [in every year]‚ and
also [to make a coming, zia, to attend there] for the afforcement
[=strengthening] of the court when there is a prisoner to be judged
or a judgment in suspense [to be awarded] in a writ of right, Thomas,
late Earl of Lancaster‚ distrained them to come to furnish every
judgment . . . . in every plaint [even though that plaint were begun]
without writ, contrary to the usages and otherwise then they were wont
to come in the time of the kings [i.e.‚ when the kings were the imme-
diate lords of the manor] and of this they pray remedy.*

Although by law and statute† every free man ought to have the
right to make his attorney by writ to do suit for him at the Court of
the Lord of whom he holds, and the tenants of the high tenure of
Pickering made their attornies by writs in the Wapentake Court of
Pickering in the times of the Kings and of all the chief Lords, yet

* Professor F. W. Maitland, who has been kind enough to give me this transla-
tion, has also added the following note :—“ The complaint is of the exaction of undue
⁶ suit of court ’ from these tenants. I have seen other cases in which tenants assert
that they do not owe suit to every session of the Court, but are only bound to
attend once or twice a year, and also to appear when there is a thies to be hanged
[‘quand0 latro est judicandus '] or when a writ of right is to be tried. Then the
Earl has been making thern come to furnish (as doomsmen) any judgment which has
been delayed. If delayez is right, he seems to have made these folk attend whenever
a cause (albeit begun without writ) was adjourned, or ‘stood over’ for want of a
sufficiency of suitors to make a judgment.

“ Ι have seen many tenants who aeknowledge their liability to attend whenever a
writ of right comes to the court or a criminal is to be condemned. In such a case
there is royal justice to be done and many are bound to attend who refuse to appear
on other occasions.”
