franchise, and took action in the local court. Here the allowance of
the claim in the Forest Eyre was an absolute bar to Sir Robert 3
judgment *for ,ζ 5 was given against him, and his only course was to
take proceedings in the King's Bench to quash the claim.

The proceedings took the form of scire facias ad audiendum errores,
the usual course taken in order to reverse a judgment that had been
given, and it is a matter of considerable regret to me that Ι have not
been able to discover what the result of the proceedings was.

At first Sir Robert appears to have admitted that there was a manor
of Ebberston‚ and that it was owned by Robert Wyerne and T homas
Thurnef3 but he denied that any owner of the manor ever had the
right to appoint a woodward 3 nay, more, that any wood belonged to
the manor (both which claims had been made by the joint lords
of the manor). As to the bark, the explanation is that while Thomas

· de Ebberston‚ a former owner of the manor, was bailiff of Pickering,

out of sear a few of the smaller tenants gave him the bark of trees
supplied to them for housebote, &o Afterwards these proceedings
were dropped and fresh initiated‚ in which Sir Robert took even stronger
ground. He maintained that there was no Manor of Ebberston at
all, that what was so-called was simply a messuage, six tofts and crofts
and two carucates of land. It is noteworthy that, at p. 16, Vol. ΙΙ.,
N.S., Robert Wyerne, the grandfather, in the year 1313, paid a fine for
entry upon his moiety of the land at Ebberston‚ described as late the
property of Amery Gegge, under a somewhat similar description—
namely, one moiety of a messuage and five and a-half oxgangs. How
the five and a—half oxgangs had increased to one carucate needs con-
sideration. That the bulk of the property was the same is probable
from p. 123, where the title to the manor is set out, namely, that
Thomas de Ebberston enfeoffed Amery Gegge of one moiety, and
Amery Gegge enfeoffed Robert Wyerne, the grandfather of the
claimant.

It appears from the Year Book (see post, p. 203) that a question arose
to the rights of Sir Robert and his tenants to sue on behalf of the
commoners. Unfortunately the case only appears in the printed edition
of the Year Book, and Ι have not been able to find it in any of the
MSS. (either in those in the British Museum or in Lincoln's Inn),
while Mr. L. O. Pike‚ who has been kind enough to help me in the
matter, and whose edition of the Year Book for the Rolls Series is so
well known, has been equally unsuccessful. He suggests that most
probably there were other MSS. from which the printed book was com-
piled, and which have since been lost, or it is also possible that the
case does appear in one of the MSS. now extant, but that in the
printed edition it has been transposed to a wrong year. As printed,
