it. At p. 236 a similar custom is stated to have lately arisen in the
forest of Galtres. At p. 245 of the Surtees Society, Vol. LXXXIII„
we have an interesting notice of the apparent existence of the custom in
the neighbouring forest of Westerdale, as John de Eure released the
Abbey of Rievaulx from providing it. The date is probably that of
the fourteenth century. Closely allied to the claim to have puture is
the claim to collect sheaves (p. 15), as well as the claim referred to in
Vol. Ι., N.S., p. 222, to collect hens. The tendency of the foresters
to extort such presents, as a matter of right, from those residing within
their jurisdiction was dealt with not only in the “Carta de Forestis ²»
(sect. 8), but also subsequently by the Act 25 Edw. III.‚ c. 5,
sect. 7.

Another perquisite to which attention should be called is the claim
when trees were given to the tenants of a manor for building purposes
(housebote), δῖα, to have the bark and the strippings. This claim is
made, at p. 82, by the foresters in fee, William de Percehay and Parnell
de Kingthorpe, and allowed, but as to trees selled for the use of the
Earl the verdict, while admitting that they had been in the habitos
enjoying the privilege, found that it was a mere matter of favour and
not of right. A similar claim, limited to the Manor of Ebberston, was
made by Robert Wyerne and Thomas Thurnef, and allowed (p. 122,
itffra). At first sight this claim does not seem to have any connection
with any forest office, on the contrary, it is claimed as appurtenant
to the Manor of Ebberston; Robert Wyerne was the grandson of
a former verderer, and Thomas Thurnef was then a regarder,
and afterwards bailiff, of Pickering. The claim was allowed, but
proceedings were subsequently taken by Sir Robert de Scarborough
and his tenant, Thomas White‚ to set it aside (p. 198). I have
collected from the Coram Rege Rolls a series of extracts relating
to the quarrel, but it is extremely difficult to get to the bottom
of the story. Who Sir Robert was I cannot say3 there was a judge
of that name, and he may have been this man. If he was, it appears
clear (see pp. 218, 219) that his judicial office was no obstacle to
his entertaining a natural and deep-rooted objection to paying his
taxes. It may have been from this cause, but more probably from
some dispute about bark, that proceedings were taken by Robert de ,
Wyerne and Thomas Thurnef against Sir Robert in the Wapentake
Court of Pickering by an action of fresh force (which corresponds to
an assize of novel disseisin in the King's Court, see Pollock and
Maitland, Vol. Ι., p. 628).

It is a pure hypothesis, but it may be that Sir Robert had refused
to give up the bark of some trees delivered to him, and Robert Wyerne
and Thomas Thurnef alleged that they had been disseised of their
