XX INTRODUCTION.

strength and weakness, to enlightenment and obstinacy, ever prevailed.
One would rather expect that by an instinctive acquiescence the elec-
tion was virtually in the hands of the few important persons in each
township, and that the amendment in the pleading connoted a verbal
distinction only, and not a distinction in fact. There is a passage in
Vol. ΙΧ., pp. 38, 39, of the Surtees Society describing the electiori of
a Bishop. No doubt the distinction between the election of a Bishop
in the twelfth century and that of a woodward in the fourteenth is very
great ; still it is important to observe that in neither case is there any
suggestion made that the view of the majority could bind the minority.

In the earlier instance we are told that there are only three methods
of electiori, by scrutiny or examination of each vote, by compromire:
and by inspirati0n‚ when a nominationis made beforehand. It appears,
therefore, that unanimity, apparent or real, is necessary either amongst
all the voters‚ or, in the case of an electiori by compromise, amongst the
persons to whom the right of election is delegated.

To return to the question of the woodwards the following points
seem established. He was a servant of the chief Lord, and in this
respect analogous to a reeve 3 he was appointed by the commoners.
and the commoners were to answer for him, but his duty was to protect
the woods within the forests for the chief Lord. He was presented at
the Court of Attachments (or possibly at the Swainmote Court), and
he had to take an oath. His duties were in general confined to the
trees alone 3 he was only to carry a hatchet 3 and though, in the case of
the woodward of Henry de Percy (p. 168), he was allowed to carry a
bow and arrows, that must be considered as an exception to the general
rule.

The foresters, on the other hand, other than the Earl’s foresters,
seem to have been servants of such of the landowners as had rights
of hunting. The forester of Brompton (p. 43), for instance, was
probably the servant of Gilbert de Aton, who had (p. 99) the right of
hunting hare, wild-cat and badger within the cultivated land at Brompton.
Ralph de Hastings claimed the right to hunt fox and hare within
the cultivated land at Allerston and F armanby, a right which, as we
saw at Vol. I., N.S., 170, his descendant, some hundred and fifty years
later, considerably enlarged. The Abbot of St. Mary's, York (p. 118),
claimed a general right of hunting fox and hare throughout the forests ς
and Thomas wake (p. 149) a right of hunting fox, hare, wild cat and
badger throughout the barony of Middleton ; the foresters of these
two latter are mentioned. Ι cannot find mention of the forester of
Henry de Perey who claimed the widest right of all at Seamer (p. 164),
namely, to hunt fox, hare, roedeer‚ wild cat and badger. The claim
as to the roedeer was for a long time a matter of contention, as it had
