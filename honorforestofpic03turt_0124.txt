also had from ancient time the chips‚ barks‚ and tops from the oaks and
other trees given away, and did what they pleased therewith, but the Earl
will not 5611 to anyone else this sort of chips‚ bark, and tree topS. They
never had anything of the oaks and other trees sold by the, Earl.
Therefore their claim faiis as to the escapes in Blansby Park, and the
chips‚ bark, and tree tops from the oaks used by the Earl.

Judgment on the claim to have escapes is postponed until Monday,
13 March, 1335. The claims to have browsewood, dry bushes
felled to the ground, nutgeld and *after-pannage is allowed. As to
William de Percehay, the officers of the forest say that one Roger de
Wrelton, of whom Alan was son and heir, held the office of forester in
see in common with Parnell at the same rent and enjoyed the same
liberties as she. After his death Thomas Earl of Lancaster seized
the office as to the purparty‚ which was Roger's. John de Bulmer per-
ceiving this went to the Earl and gave him to understand that the pur-
party of Roget belonged to him and no one else by inheritance‚ so
that the Earl in exchange for a house and a virgate of land which he
gave to John de Bulmer, obtained a release of the purparty and re-
tained it in his own hands.

* This suggests an origin sor the dual number of foresters -namely, that the office
had descended to co-heiresses.
