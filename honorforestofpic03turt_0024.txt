xviii INTRODUCTION.

were persons of standing in the district, or their servants on their
behalf. The woods stand, however, in a different position. There
can be little doubt that the effect of the forest laws upon them caused
far more than a mere sentimental grievance, and that it was of
particular importance whether or no a wood waS, or was not, ‘⁶ quit of
regard. ' We have traces of four classes of woods within Pickering
Forest-(I) Those owned by a township 3 (2) those owned by an
individua13 (3) those owned by the Earl, in which there were rights
of common, and (4) those owned by the Earl in which there were
not: but it is by no means certain that the first and second class
were distinct. We may possibly have merely two different methods of
describing the same class of wood.

Whether the wood belonged to the Lord of Forest, or whether
it belonged to an individual, unless it was “quit of regard,’' or unless
there was some special custom to authorise it, no tree could be felled
in it, at Vol. IL, N.S., p. 242, we have seen that Kingthorpe Wood,
which belonged to Roger de Mansergh, was valued at nothing, because
it lay within a forest. It is therefore, at first sight, difficult to
appreciate wherein the exact difference lay in the method of exercising
rights over the woods of the first three classes. An inquisition
(printed at Vol. L, N.S., p. 1) was taken in the year 1251, before the
date of the grant to Earl Edmund, and the several rights of the
tenants of Pickering are set out in detail, They enjoyed the right of
gathering dry sticks for fueljwithout view of the foresters, and they were
entitled to have wood delivered to them by the foresters for their
houses and hedges, and the repair of their ploughs.

Speaking generally, it appears from the record of the Eyre that at
its date the several tenants within the forest were in possession of
similar rights over all the woods within the ambit of the forest. It
has already been seen that the livery by the foresters was often made
the occasion by the foresters of obtaining some advantage for them-
selves3 where there was livery of housebote, the trees so delivered
could only be used within the forest 3 it was an offence to sell them, it
was equally an offence to carry them outside (see pp. 14 and 15,

infra), hence we can understand the importance of the question
whether housebote could be taken without livery.

Gilbert de Aton was presented (pp. 1 1 and 22) for having taken
wood for housebote out of certain woods in Troutsdale, and for having
sold trees out of it3 he claimed that he was justified (pp. 98 and 153)
in doing so, on the ground that the woods in question were “ quit of
regard.'' The jury admitted his claim as to part, but after having had
a view of the place they found that he was encroaching to the north,
and was claiming a larger area than he in fact possessed. The place-
