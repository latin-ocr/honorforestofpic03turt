Cattle taken in the forest.

As to cattle within the forest forfeited as well within the demesne as
in fence month‚ the Jury present that a young horse of John Prest of
Ebberton was found in Dalby unagisted on ward* being made, and
was taken as forfeited by the assize of the forest. It was valued at
3⁵ 4d and restored to John, on his undertaking to produce it at the
present Eyre. His surety was Richard de Dalby. He fails to appear,
therefore he is in mercy, and is charged with payment to the lord of
the value.

Five hogs, the property of Robert, son of Lambert, were found
unagisted within the covert in time of pannage, value 5⁵. Robert is
responsible.

Six hogs, the property of Alan, the son of Alan, were found unagisted
within the covert in time of pannage.
