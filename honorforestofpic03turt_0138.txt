IOO DUCHY OF LANCASTER RECORDS.

Rex Anglie‚ progenitor domini Regis nunc, dedit et concessit per cartam
suam cuidam Reginaldo Belet‚ antecessori ipsius Gilberti, cujus statum
ipse modo habet, per centum et decem solidos per annum undecim
carucate [sic] terre et unam bovatam in Aton et Prestona et tresdecim
bovatas terre in Ebrest0n‚ que modo sunt maneria de Howeton et Aton,
et precepit ut bene, honorifice et libere teneret cum socha etc., et cum
omnibus consuetudinibus suis sicut ipse melius tenebat dum fuerunt in
manu sua; virtute cujus carte idem Reginaldus seisitus fuit de hujus-
modi proficuis in clamiis suis contentis. Et ipse similiter et omnes
antecessores sui post predictum Reginaldum tenentes maneria predicta
semper et continue virtute carte predicte de eisdem seisiti fuerunt et
adhuc est, et hoc paratus est verificare per ministros foreste prout
Curia etc. in bosco suo etc. Et quoad habere wodewardum etc. in
bosco apud At0n‚ et habere wodewardum etc. in bosco suo apud
Brumpton et similiter wodewardum in bosco suo apud Howeton
dicit quod ipse et omnes antecessores sui a tempore quo non
extat memoria usi sunt habere wodewardos in boscis suis predictis, et
hoc paratus est verificare prout Curia etc., et petit quod clamia sua
predicta ei in hac parte allocentur. Et quia videtur Justiciariis quod
expediens [297b] est et necesse per ministros foreste inquirere qualiter
idem Gilbertus et antecessores sui libertatibus illis in clamiis suis
contentis usi sunt et gavisi, ideo inquiratur inde veritas per eosdem.
Qui jurati et onerati dicunt super sacramentum suum quod idem
Gilbertus et omnes antecessores sui semper a tempore quo non extat

 

He pleads further, that Henry ΙΙ. granted by deed to one Reginald
Belet, his ancestorswhose estate he now holds, for the yearly sum of
955 10⁵, eleven carucates of land and one oxgang in Ayton and
Prest0n‚ and thirteen oxgangs in Ebberston, which now comprise the
manors of Hutton Bushel and Ayton, to be held freely with full
jurisdiction and with all customs as the King held it when it was in his
hands, By virtue of which deed Reginald was seised of the rights
already claimed of pasturing goats, uprooting heather and bracken‚
digging ‘curves and agisffing, and in like manner he and all his ancestors
after Reginald holding the same manor, have been seised of the same
rights by virtue of the grant. This he is ready to prove. He is
also ready to prove that he and his ancestors have ever srom ancient
time had the two woodwards. He prays that his claims may be allowed.

As the Justices consider that it is expedient that an inquiry
be made by the Officers of the forest how Gilbert and his ancestors
have enjoyed the rights so claimed, an inquiry is directed. It is
found that Gilbert and his ancestors ever from ancient time held
Troutsdale Wood appurtenant to the manor os Brompton as out-
