and committed many other wrongful acts as well against King as
people, which will certainly be discovered whenever it please the
King to direct his Justices to hold an inquiry. Wherefore they pray
the King, for his own profit and for the relief of his people, that such
stewards and bailiffs be not employed by the Court, nor put in office
until their condition be examined by a jury of the country, for so

practise upon the King without redress.

A Petition to King and Council of Roger the Carter‚ burgess of
Scarborough. He provided a ship at his own eost on behalf of the
commonalty of Scarborough for the King’s service in Gascony, which
ship lost its anchors, cables and other fittings to the value of Α 30,
but the commonalty would not contribute to the loss. He therefore

prays that a writ of contribution may be directed to the bailisfs and
great men of the town, since he can prove before them the damage
which he has suffered by this loss.

[Endorsed] Let the bailiffs and great men of the town be directed
to make contribution, as is the custom in other like seaport places.

'⁸‘ The later form of this, le Roy se avz'sera, came in time to mean that the King
declined to assent to the petition.
