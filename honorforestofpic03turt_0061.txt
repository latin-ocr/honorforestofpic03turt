est et petit quod inquiratur per omnes ministros istius foreste. Ideo
inquiratur* inde veritas per eosdem.

Iidem jurati presentant quod cum in instanti itinere allocatum sit
forestariis de feodo in le Estward [Ρ Westward] in clamiis suis quod
habeant cabilicia illa videlicet que per hachettum subforestariorum
possunt dilacerari a stipidibus et non alia, Willelmus de Percy
[Ρ Percehay] miles unus forestariorum de feodo grandes ramos quer-
cuum vento in parte a stipidibus dilaceratos et quosdam ad terram
inclinatos et quosdam ad terram prostratos qui per cornerium hachetti
sui non poterat dilacerare a stipidibus et quosdam radices grandes
quercuum indies similiter fodit, succidit et asportavit ad dampnum
domini. Ideo preceptum est vicecomiti quod venire faciat eum.
Postea venit predictus Willelmus de Percy et inde allocutus dicit quod
ipse nichil fecit contra allocacionem in instanti itinere sibi factam et
hoc petit quod inquiratur per ministros ejusdem foreste. Ideo
inquiratur per eosdem. Qui scilicet viridarii† et regardatores ad hoc
jurati dicunt super sacramentum suum quod idem Willelrnus cepit tres
carrectatas bosci de grandis [? grandibus] ramis et stipidibus et radicibus
quercuum contra formam allocacionis sibi facte. Ideo idem Willelmus
committitur prisone et forestaria predicta capiatur in manum domini.
Postea venit predictus Willelrnus et peciit quod possit admitti ad finem
faciendum cum domino Comite in hac parte et pro forestaria sua reha-
benda et admittitur per finem xiijs iiijd prout patet in rotulis de finibus.

summoned, appears, pleads not guilty and claims an inquiry. The
inquiry is directed.

The jury present that whereas in the present Eyre the claims of the
foresters of fee in the Westward to have such browsewood as could be
cut from the stems by the billhooks of the under foresters and none
else was allowed, yet Sir William de Percehay, one of the foresters of
fee, has cut off huge branches of oak partly severed from the stems by
the wind, and some that were hanging down to the ground, and some
that were felled to the ground which he could not sever with the edge
of his billhook, and has dug up some huge roots of oaks and carried
all away. He is summoned, appears, and denies that he has done
aught in contravention to the claim as allowed. He asks for an
inquiry which is directed. The verderers and regarders say that he
took three cartloads of wood, composed of huge branches, stems, and
roots‚ in contravention of what he was allowed. He is sentenced to
be imprisoned and his office is seized in the Earl’s hands. Afterwards,

at his request, he is permitted to compound for his offence and for the
restoration of his office at the sum of 13⁵ 4d.

³⁶ See later p. 98. † The omission of foresters may be intentional.
