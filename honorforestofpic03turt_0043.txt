brigge que* dictus Prior modo tenet, dictos pontem et viam repararunt
et sustentarunt, et hoc parata est verificare per ministros istius foreste.
Et Prior predictus per attornatum suum dicit quod ipse nec tenetur
dictos pontem et viam· reparare racione terrarum seu tenementorum
aliquorum que tenet, prout eadem Priorissa asserit, set eadem Priorissa
terras et tenementa tenet apud Yedyngham et alibi, per que tenetur
eos reparare et sustentare, et hoc similiter petit quod inquiratur. Et
predicta Priorissa similiter. Ideo inquiratur inde veritas per ministros
ejusdem foreste. Qui scilicet forestarii, viridarii et regardatores ad hoc
jurati dicunt super sacramentum suum quod Magister et Fratres ordinis

Prior Hospitalis modo tenet pontem predictum qui in solo suo

and elsewhere, is bound to repair and maintain them. He and the
Prioress both ask that an inquiry may be directed. The foresters,
'verderers‚ and regarders being sworn, say on their oaths that the
Templars before the abolition of their Order, by reason of their
tenure of lands which the Prior of the Hospitallers now holds,
repaired and maintained the bridge which stands entirely on their own
ground, and likewise repaired and maintained the road to the east of
the bridge, and the Prior, by reason of his tenure of the same lands,
is bound to repair and maintain as often as need requires the bridge
and road to the east of it. Further they say that the Prioress, inas-
much as the bridge stands entirely on the Prior's ground, is bound to
