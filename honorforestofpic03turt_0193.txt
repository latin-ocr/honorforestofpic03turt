for themselves, their men and tenants of Farmandby, Kingthorpe and
Ellerburn in the woods, moors and pastures of the same townships,
and for themselves and their men os Wilton, and for themselves, their
men and tenants of Allerston in the woods, moors and pastures of that
township without payment 3 ancl for themselves, their men ancl tenants
of Farmandby, Kingthorpe‚ Ellerburn, Allerston and Ebberston to be
quit of pannage in the mast season in the woods and moors of those
townships 3 for themselves, their men and tenants of Farmandby, King-

their men and tenants of F armandby, to have housebote and hedgebote

their curtilage and the town ditem* and to collect nuts for estovers in
the wood of Farmandby, and a like right for themselves, their men and
tenants of Ellerburn, Allerston and Ebberston in the woods of those
townships. They claim to enjoy the rights after-mentioned by virtue
of a grant made by King Henry Ι. to Archbishop Gerard of York of
the churches of Pocklington, Driffield, Kilham, Pickering, Aldborough

* As a possible explanation I would suggest that this was the ditch round the
common field, on the bank of which a fence appears to have been made.
