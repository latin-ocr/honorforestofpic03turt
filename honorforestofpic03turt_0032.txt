xxvi INTRODUCTION.

The road leading to the bridge stood, however, in a different posi-
tion. In the year 1762, sor the distance of nearly a mile, it was in
such bad repair that the township of Pickering was indicted at
Quarter Sessions. The matter was respited from Sessions to Sessions
for nearly two years. The following is the result :——At first the town-
ship admitted its liability. Afterwards it obtained leave to withdraw its
plea of guilty, and to plead that from the north end of the parts called
Birgo or Virgo Lane to Howe Bridge, it was repairable in two sections,
as to the Birgo Lane by the occupiers of the land on the east, and
as to the remainder by the occupiers on both sides. As to the part to
the north of Birgo Lane the township confessed its liability. At the
date of these prooeedings, so we learn from the proceedings in 1876,
all the land to the south of Birgo Lane was uninclosed, part being
known as Smith's Moor and part as Hicks' Moor, called after their
respective occupiers. The occupiers of the several lands appeared and
admittted their liability to repair the causeway for horse and packway,
but not the carriage and cartway. The matter was tried and the verdict
was in favour of the township ; the liability to repair the whole of
the road from the north end of Birgo Lane to Howe Bridge being cast
upon the occupiers.

The following year the first of a series of Turnpike Acts, by which
the Malton and Pickering road was directed to be amended, widened,
and converted into a turnpike road, was passed. Amongst other
things the occupiers of the land burdened with repair, Marmaduke
Hicks, Peter Smith. and Thomas clifford, were directed to perform six
days' statute work in every year upon the road, and were exempted
from further work. This provision was repealed in the year 1804, by
the Act 44 Geo. HL, e. 63 (sects. 6, 7), the latter of which directs the
application of ,ζ 100 a year out of the tolls on the road, and appears
to restore the former liability ratione tenurae of the occupants to
supplement any deficit. When the Turnpike Trust came to an end, the
question as to the liability arose in another form. In the year 1876 it
was held by Mellor and Lush, J.J.‚ that the effect of the widening of
the road was to destroy the old liability ratione tenurae 3 while the
statutory liability, imposed by the Act of 1804, only continued so long
as the Act remained in force. The decision, I confess, seems to me
to have been sound 3 though the effect was to saddle the township with
the repair of the road, and to exempt the occupants of the land, yet it
would have been far more unjust to have saddled the occupants with
the increased cost of keeping in repair a wider road of a different
nature. No doubt provision should and ought to have been made by
the Turnpike Acts for continuing the apportionment of the eost of
repair after the expiration of the Acts. From p. 2 of the present
