INTRODUCTION. xvii

within and not without the forest. But what is material is that in
either case an injury had been done to the inhabitants by a forester,
and, moreover, by one whose name (Robert de Wigan) denotes that he,
or some near ancestor‚ had migrated from some other part of the
possessions of the Earls of Lancaster.

Too great stress should not, of course, be laid upon these extortions
as if they were peculiar to forests; it was an age, as the Coram Rege
Rolls of the period show, when officers misused their power 3 but I
must not conclude without referring to the charges against the bailiff
of Pickering, referred to at pp. 217 and 219, of having extorted the
sum of ,g 1 from a man whom he had arrested.

Closely allied with the right of receiving bark and strippings from
felled timber was the right of having the dry branches after they had
been cut and the leaves used for food for the deer in winter—in
other words, cablz'cz‘a or browse-wood. It was the foresters in see (see
p. 84) who claimed and were allowed this right. It was a right which
could very easily be abused. At p. 23 we have an offence for which
Sir William de Percehay, one of the foresters in fee, was fined 13S 4d;
and which appears to have consisted in cutting down larger branches
than was either necessary or lawful.

In the Articles of the Court of Eyre‚ in Waltham Forest (A.D. 1634),
(Harl. MSS„ No. 68, 39, fol. 261), inquiry is, by Art. 43, directed to
ascertain “ If anie forester or keeper browseth any mast boughes of
greate oakes in winter more for his own gaine than for sustenance of
the deer.''

At the same time the claim must be read in connection with the
claim of John de Melsa (pp. 1, 111 and 158) to make charcoal out
of this same browsewood 3 and of the Dean and Chapter of York
(p. 127) to take browsewood within the township of Pickering. As to
this last, I am by no means sure that I exactly apprehend what it
means. It is possible that the claim is simply to take browsewood
when required for housebote and hedgebote. From Vol. 1.‚ N.S.,
pp. 29, 34 and 181, we learn that at a later date the right of the
foresters in fee to this browsewood was disputed, although they appear,
notwithstanding, to have appropriated and sold it.

HAVING regard to the difficulty under which the ordinary man laboured
in early days with the means then at his disposal in his attempt to take
game, it is not probable that the severity of the forest laws in respect
of poaching offences pressed quite so heavily on the lower orders as
writers are often in the habit of maintaining. In a preceding volume
I have called attention to the fact that for the most part the offenders
