been clearly proved that it was a forest offence to kill roedeer. How-
ever, eventually the claim was allowed—a result to which the connection
by marriage between Henry de Percy and Earl Henry (see p. 164 n.),
may have contributed.

The salary of the forester at Hovingham (p. 229) should be observed,
as it no doubt represented the usual salary at that date.

Before concluding these remarks reference should be made to the
claim (at p. 150) by Thomas Wake, to have livery of wood for him-
self and his tenants once a year at the next Attachment Court after
Michaelmas. The claim was first disallowed because the Jury found
that he ought to have it at every Attachment Court, and not only once
a year: it was eventually amended and allowed. Why the mere fact
of asking too little should be a ground for disallowing the claim is not
at first sight apparent. Perhaps it was due to a spirit of technicality
in the JudgeS‚ who considered that the claim and the verdict should
agree word for word3 or perhaps it was in order to endeavour to
compe] the attendance of the tenants at every Attachment Court. In
the seventeenth century (see Vol. ΙΙ., N.S.‚ p. 3) the Swainmote Court
was held at Michaelmas, amongst other times, and I was, therefore, at
first under the impression that it did not exist under that name at the
date of the Eyre, and that it was merelya development of the Michael-
mas Attachment Court, which, from the claim of Thomas Wake, appears
to have been of greater importance than the rest. Later investigation
has, however, shaken my belief in this view. In a Coram Rege Roll a
few years later than the Eyre, which I shall probably print in the next
volume, there is a reference to the Swainmote Court by name, and it
is not probable, though it is possible, that it acquired this name in the
interval. It is, however, noteworthy that the Swainmote Court should
not be once mentioned by name in the whole Eyre.

COMMONS.

IN the Inquisition printed at p. 1 of Vol. I., N .S.‚ to which Ι have
already referred, we learn that the tenants of the demesne land enjoyed
common of pasture for all manner of animals except goats in all the
woods other than Blansby Park and Dalby Hay. This may be taken
as typical of the rights of common of pasture referred to in this
volume. From pages 47 to 64 we have a list of cattle that had been
seized by the foresters. It is impossible for me to say with even
approximate accuracy what the offence in each case was. In some
cases the cattle were pastured in the Earl's demesnes where no right
of common existed, such as Dalby Hay and Blansby Park, to which
probably Allantofts, Langdale, and Scalby Hay should be added. In
others they were pastured in the fence mouth, namely‚ from fifteen
