The men of Scarborough, who by the King's Charter are exempt
from answering outside their town, pray that the Justices of Lord
Edmund, the King’s brother, who are distraining them to answer as to
the articles of the forest at Pickering, and are amercing them at 5540
for not having come there [may be restrained]. They were not wont
to come, and the fines in both Eyres should be levied to the King's
use 3 but now they are being forced to act contrary to their custom.

The petitions of Lord Edmund before the King.

Henry 111. granted to him Pickering Forest, but strangers osten
commit offences of vert and venison therein, and without the help of the
King's Court he can get no compensation, nor can he of the other
matters which are impleaded in Forest Eyres. He prays that he may
be granted such an estate that he may have the fines and the amount
that belongs to him.

Further he prays the King to direct by writ certain tenants whose
names are written beneath of the Honor of Lancaster, of West Wales
and elsewhere, to do homage to him. Henry III. granted to him the
homages of them, and he asks for the same writ that Henry III.
granted to him. The following hold elsewhere in chief of the King
