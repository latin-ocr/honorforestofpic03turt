xvi INTRODUCTION.

there appear to be obvious errors‚ and though I have suggested cor-
rections, not being able to collate it with any MS., I cannot feel sure
that my conjectures are right.

The ordinary rule in later days applicable to scire facias in errore was
that all parties against whom judgment was given ought regularly to
join in Error (see “Comyn’s Digest,'' tit. Pleader 3, B. 9). The diffi-
culty seems to have been to ascertain against whom the judgment in
Eyre must be considered to have been given. That the allowance of
the claim injured the commoners there could be no doubt, but it
appears by no means clear that the commoners could have appeared
personally at the Eyre and been heard to object to the claim. The
argument, however, of Skipwith, counsel for Robert Wyerne and
Thomas Thurnef, was that in the reverse case, if the commoners had
wished to make a claim,'all must have claimed, and not two on behalf
of the rest. The judgment does not, however, appear to adopt this
view. Mr. Justice Bankwell suggests that the argument was unsound
in a case where the Forest Laws were applicable, although it might
be otherwise in the case of land outside a forest.

I shall have occasion later to refer to these proceedings3 at
present it is only material to call attention to the allegation that from
a mere casual gift, arising out of sear and a hope to curry favour, a
prescriptive right was sought to be established.

We meet with a similar feature (see p. 115, infra) in the case of
Langhowdale‚ or Langatdale Wood‚ which, so far as I can idenfify,
lay between Pickering and EUerburn, and possibly is that now marked on
the Ordnance Map as Howedale VVood (see Vol. L, N.S.‚ p. 98). Sir
Ralph Hastings claimed this wood as his own, but if the verdict of
the jury is to be relied on, he had no right to it; his claim being simply
based upon a payment of a penny or a halfpenny a week which his
woodwards extorted from poor folk who gathered wood with0ut
being entitled to do so. From Vol. 1., N.S.‚ pp. 28 and 97, it is quite
clear that this wood belonged to the Duchy in the seventeenth
century. ,

But it was not only by their pretensions to rights and perquisites that
the foresters made themselves so detested: at pp. 13 to 15 we find
a number of offences presented against thern. Their servants extort
money srorn people who pass through the forest, though whether the
offence consists in taking the money, or in the fact that it was by
persons who had not been duly sworn, is not quite clear. The sarne
remark applies to the offence that is next mentioned. It may be that
it was wrong for foresters to seize cattle of one township that had
merely strayed on the waste of another township, both being within
the forest, or it may be that the impounding should have taken place
